          PlayPulse is a video site with the feel of 2019 and 2020: channels, uploads, a watch page, a home feed,
          subscriptions, search, likes, comments, Snips, a creator studio, analytics and moderation. Each feature was
          built in its own session and filmed, so the code and the docs are meant to be easy to follow.
