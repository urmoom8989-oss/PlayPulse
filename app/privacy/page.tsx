            <strong>Your account:</strong> email address, name, username, picture, bio and birthday. The birthday is only
            used to check that you are 13 or older and is never shown.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your channel and videos:</strong> what you upload and type in, plus the processed copies of your videos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What you do:</strong> likes, subscriptions, comments, reports, your watch history and where you stopped
            in a video. You can clear or pause your history at any time in History.

          <li>
            <strong>Views:</strong> view counts and watch time for the creator&apos;s analytics. Signed out views are
            counted with a random id kept in your browser, not your name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Messages:</strong> what you send with the <Link href="/contact">contact form</Link>, with your name and
            email address so we can reply.

      <Section title="Network addresses">
        <p>
          To stop abuse, searches and the contact form are limited per network address. For the contact form only a
          scrambled (hashed) form of the address is kept. The server logs that every web server writes are cleared
          regularly.

      <Section title="Cookies">
        <p>
          PlayPulse uses cookies only to keep you signed in. Your theme and player settings (volume, quality) are kept in
          your own browser.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="Who else sees it">
        <p>
          The site runs on rented servers and services that store data on our behalf: the database and sign in (Supabase),
          video files (the configured object-storage provider) and the network in front of the site (Cloudflare). Nothing
          is sold or shared for advertising.
