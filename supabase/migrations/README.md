## How to apply them

Switch on `pg_cron` under **Database > Extensions** first (the stats rollup and
the trash purge are scheduled with it; without it those files only print a
notice).

**A new project, all at once.** `scripts/db-migrations.mjs` puts every file in
order into one SQL file, or runs them with `psql`:

```bash
npm run db:migrations > all-migrations.sql        # paste into the SQL editor and Run
npm run db:migrations -- --apply "postgresql://..."  # or run them with psql
```

The connection string is under the project's **Connect** button (Session
pooler). It holds the database password: keep it out of git and out of issues.

**A project that already has some.** Run only the new files, in number order:
paste each one into the [SQL editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new)
and click **Run**, or `npm run db:migrations -- --from 021 --apply "postgresql://..."`.
Do not run the whole set again on a project that has it: a later file can
change what an earlier one made (`016` widens the `comment_cards` view that
`012` creates, so `012` fails once `016` is in). Each file on its own can be
run twice in a row.

## Rules

- **Numbered.** Files run in number order. Never rename or renumber an existing file.
- **Re-runnable.** Running a file twice must be harmless. Use `create table if not exists`,
  `create or replace function`, `drop policy if exists` before `create policy`, and so on.
- **Row level security on.** Every new table gets `enable row level security` and explicit policies.
- **Never edit an applied migration.** Fix things in a new, higher numbered file.
- **Views.** `create or replace view` cannot drop or reorder columns. When a new file changes a
  view's columns, use `drop view if exists ...` then `create view`, so older files stay re-runnable.
