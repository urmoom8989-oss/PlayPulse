// 302 to a short lived presigned storage URL. If the playlists were redirected too,
// the player would resolve the relative names inside them ("720p/index.m3u8",
// "seg_00001.m4s") against the presigned storage URL and ask the bucket directly, without a
// signature, and get 403. So playlists are small text files the route reads
// from the bucket and hands over itself, with every URI rewritten to the route.
